Unofficial JW Broadcasting plugin for Kodi
==========================================

*This is a fork/continuation of the older "JW Broadcasting (unofficial)" add-on for Kodi. It is not officially supported by the Watchtower Society. Do not contact jw.org for support, instead please leave an issue here on GitHub if you run into any problems.* 

## The best TV channel ever

Browse [JW Broadcasting](https://tv.jw.org) on your Kodi box! Watch streams, listen to sound recordings and watch the latest videos in any available language.

The best way to watch it  is using an officially supported device with the officially supported [JW Broadcasting App](https://www.jw.org/en/online-help/jw-broadcasting/). The Watchtower Society urges people to use their official apps, instead of third-party software like Kodi add-ons ([w18 April page 30-31](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2018364)).

## Installation

There are multiple ways you can install this add-on. You could use `git clone` or Download ZIP from GitHub.

But the easiest way is to install it from my repo. This way you'll receive updates automatically (if I remember to upload them):

1. Download [this ZIP](https://github.com/allejok96/repository.allejok96/raw/master/downloads/repository.allejok96.zip)
1. In Kodi: click on "Add-ons"
1. Click on the little box icon in the upper left hand corner
1. "Install from zip file"
1. Browse to the directory with the zip and select it
1. Click on "Install from repository"
1. "allejok96's Repository > Video add-ons > JWB Unofficial > Install"

## Disclaimer

The benefits of this add-on are countless, but there are some risks, as the WT article above points out:

* When tv.jw.org improves, this add-on may break, misbehave or lag behind.
* If someone hacked my repo, they could forge the spiritual food (extremely unlikely).

But since you found this page I guess you know what you're doing.

#### Why not in Kodi official repository?

The original author of this add-on, who wishes to stay anonymous, decided to take it down for personal reasons. Including some of the reasons mentioned above. It really got me thinking, and I decided to play it safe, even if I would continue to develope the add-on. After all, it's not just any random video site we're talking about...

So my wish is that *you* take responsibility for the installations *you* make. Chances are if you found this page, you can install a zip in Kodi. Maybe your aunt can't, but then you can help her. It's better that you be there for your aunt if something happens, than me having a 1000 aunts broken Broadcasting on my conscience.

You may be of a different opinion, but please respect my personal desicion. And if you want to change something, it's open source, so go ahead and fork it. 

#### Is this legal?

Yes, this is concidered "proper use". The [Terms of Service](http://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use/) allows for:

> distribution of free, non-commercial applications designed to download electronic files such as EPUB, PDF, MP3, and MP4 files from public areas of jw.org.
